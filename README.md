The main goal of project: customisable image slideshow, usable in windowed (optionaly in fullscreen) mode.

Most image viewers, which i tried to use, can't play slideshow in windowed mode, usually it is played in fullscreen mode. Obviously typical slideshow usage  implies usage exactly fullscreen mode, but replay s. in windowed mode have another reason. This reason: playback images in "background mode" in very small window, which will not only not distract user from work or other activity, but also relax. In other words, the reason is the same as for listening to music while working. 
On the other hand, the app is meant to be not minimalistic (read: do almost nothing), but customizable as much as possible.
